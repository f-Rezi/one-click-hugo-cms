This [week](/wdwdw) we **wont** give a shit about artisanal coffee\*.

In 2021, at the [Institute of Retardland](https://th.wallhaven.cc/lg/d5/d5kx1j.jpg) said that the stupid Coffeemaker is *"one of the worst-designed products of modern times"*, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Shitposts of Retardland.

## The little secrets of Nontypical Fortune Cookies

The typical f-Rezi NFT consists of an hourglass-shaped woman drinking coffee naked. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated f-Rezident NFTs.
2. Use Paintswap, don’t try to sell them on Zoopet.
3. Never skip preheating the booyhole.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget to lose money.

The most visually distinctive feature of the stupid NFT is the tamperproof verified code, allowing it to be handled and abused by welcome retards. The pieces are held loosely in place by a leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the female form.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural dumbassery and the organic nature of a hand-cusped boobies with the laboratory nature of thonghood was a distinctive feature of its appearance.
